# Punkbuster Screenshot Viewer (PBSViewer)
Welcome! This tool is based on an older program that I had used for my clan. Now I have made a totally new version with better updating features and less bugs. I have put a lot of hours into this project, I hope you will enjoy it!

# System recommendations
- PHP version 5.0 or higher.
- MySQL version 4.0 or higher.
- Webhosting that supports .htaccess files.
- Punkbuster server with ftp acces to your pb screens directory.

## Help needed
Since I don't have the time to test all environments, I need your help. If you have installed this tool under another environment, please tell me so I can change this list.

#Supported games

Below is a list of the games which are supported.

- AA - America's Army 2.8.5

Probably there are more games which are compatible with this tool, but I haven't tested it. So if your game is not on the list you can give it a try if you want. Keep in mind this tool only support games that run on pb, a full list of pb supported games can be seen here. If this tool works for a game that is not mentioned in the above list, please contact me. Then I can add your game to this list.
