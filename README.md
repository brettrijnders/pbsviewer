## Install

  - Add detailed error message about ftp connection if something goes wrong during or after install

## Misc
  - Multi-server support, servers can be added in admin menu
  - Separate page where admin can keep track of all statistics, for example total download size of all .png files.
  - Bandwidth limiter to prevent that admin reach his/her limit of web hosting
  - History of player and screens
