=Install=
==Why do you need my ftp login details during install?==
Those ftp login details are needed to download the screenshots from your gameserver and store them on your webserver. Once they are stored you can easily browse through your screens using PBSViewer.

==I have a gameserver running on windows, can I use PBSViewer?==
Yes it should be possible, though you need to download a minor fix.

==What do I need to fill in for 'PB path'?==
During install PB path needs to be filled in. The PB path is referring to the pb directory on your game server. PBSViewer is going to connect through ftp to your gameserver to download the latest screenshots. Those screenshots are then stored on your webserver. 

=Usage=
==After update the download folder is still empty, what is wrong?==
That is hard to say, multiple things can be wrong. In case you are running your gameserver on windows you might want to check this [FAQ#I_have_a_gameserver_running_on_windows,_can_I_use_PBSViewer? link].

Here is a list of things that can go wrong:
    * Wrong pb path has been filled in during install, please check this
    * You are running old version of PHP, PBSViewer is made for PHP 5
    * Something went wrong with CHMODDING, please check if all the files and directories are CHMODDED correctly
