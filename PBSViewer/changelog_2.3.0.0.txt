Changelog 2.3.0.0:
------------------------------------

- Added Light theme
- Implemented issue 12, users can now easily change theme in ACP.
- Added incremental update feature, see issue 44.
- Added function 'print_array_short(...)', this function shows only a limited amount of array values. It does something similar as print_r(...).
- Added ACP option to automatically delete log files from gameserver when logging feature is used, see issue 43.
- Implemented ACP option to change pb screenshot and pb log directory names, see issue 41.
- Added an update script, user don't need to do a full reinstall anymore in order to update to a newer version.
- Added more detailed debug messages.
- Bug fix: PBSViewer now correctly parses the guids and ip adresses using the log files. The bug is caused due to the fact that some game servers do not specify if a guid is valid or invalid.
- Bug fix: replaced ftp_nlist with a custom function in order to retrieve files. Thank you Damjan Nemarnik for providing me access to your servers for testing.
- Bug fix: reset functionality kept giving error "seems to be the wrong directory, did not delete any files". Thank you Douglas Carr for pointing this out.
